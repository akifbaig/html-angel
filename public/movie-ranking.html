<h1>The places Akif would like to live in this world</h1>
<h2>These are the top two cities I would like to settle forever.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Dubai</h3>
<p>This is my first priority. I dream of living the middle eastern lifestyle. Being a muslim, i love to be at a place where i can get the best of both the worlds.</p>
<h3>Mecca/Medina</h3>
<p>This would've been first on my list but as i said, i want the best of both the worlds. Also, practically speaking, living in Saudi Arabia is much tougher due to it's strict laws for immigrants.</p>
